## Changelog

- **2024-12-XX:** **MAJOR REFACTOR** - Consolidated separate Jira and Freshdesk boxes into one unified main box

    - Shows data freshness indicators and source links for both platforms
    - Enhanced copy functionality for all fields including summaries and details

- 2024-06-XX: Fixed bug in content_script.js where classNames.includes could throw a TypeError if className was not a string (e.g., for SVG elements). Now, classNames and id are always checked to be strings before using .includes(). This prevents runtime errors in the Freshdesk MutationObserver logic.
